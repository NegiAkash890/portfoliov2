React Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

### 1) useState Hook

useState to Create State Variables. The useState hook allows us to create state variables in a React function component.

State allows us to access and update certain values in our components over time

When we create a state variable, we must provide it a default value (which can be any data type).

We get that state variable as the first value in an array, which we can destructure and declare with const.

const [value, setValue] =useState(0)

for using the state we use 'value' in our component and for updating the state we use setValue()
